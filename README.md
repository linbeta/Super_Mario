# Motion Detection Game (Super Mario)

This is an awesome project using opencv to detect motions to trigger key-press signals.
The demo video was using the classic Super Mario to showcase the program.

## What I modified

On line 30 in ```main.py```, make the image flip, it's easier for me to control my motion on mirror image.
```Python
image = cv2.flip(image, 1)
```

In ```controls.py``` switch the keys ```a``` and ```d```, so that it would follow the change with the flipped mirror image.

## Notice

It would be a little annoying if you place the text cursor on the wrong place. 😂
It's better if you click on any place before you run this program.
